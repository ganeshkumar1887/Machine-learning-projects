This project focuses on building a Spam Email Detection System using Machine Learning and NLP.
The model classifies emails as Spam or Ham using the Naive Bayes algorithm.
Text data is converted into numerical features using CountVectorizer.
The system achieves high accuracy and demonstrates how real-world email spam filters work.
